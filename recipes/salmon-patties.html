    <h2>Pantry meal that's ready in just 30 minutes!</h2>

    <p>Also known as salmon cakes, these salmon patties are one of my favorite things to make with canned salmon. You can make them with cooked fresh salmon, but the real selling point for me is how fast they are to make with canned salmon on busy weeknights since it's already cooked!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon - canned pink or sockeye is best for flavor and texture</li>
        <li>Egg - a classic binding agent</li>
        <li>Mayo - gives these patties moisture and a touch of creaminess</li>
        <li>Panko breadcrumbs - they're a fine breadcrumb that helps hold the patties together</li>
        <li>Lemon juice - a pop of brightness that really complements salmon</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce - added savory taste</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard - just a touch amps up the flavor even more!</li>
        <li>Parsley and dill - fresh herbs are a wonderful way to pack in even more deliciousness</li>
        <li>Scallions - these mild green onions go great with salmon</li>
        <li>Olive oil - for frying up these patties until crispy and golden brown</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the salmon and add it to a medium prep bowl. If your salmon isn't boneless/skinless, pick those pieces out. Flake the salmon with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients (except for the olive oil) to the bowl and mix together gently.</li>
        <li>Form into 6 patties that are about 1/2" thick.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes, then fry the patties in two batches for about 3-4 minutes/side or until they're lightly browned on both sides. Add a splash more oil to the pan for the second batch if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm. I love to serve these with tzatziki or remoulade sauce (or any garlicky mayo/aioli will work!) along with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
