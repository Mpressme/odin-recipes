    <h2>Perfect fast weeknight dinner</h2>

    <p>It took me a few tries before I was confident in sharing this shrimp fettuccine Alfredo recipe. They were all minor tweaks to get that sauce just right. I am definitely happy with the finished product, and I hope you will be too! In this recipe, cooking shrimp for Alfredo is easy... they just cook right in the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Shrimp (I used frozen raw 31-40 count per pound size shrimp. You could use smaller or larger. If using smaller ones, take care not to overcook them)</li>
        <li>Butter (unsalted)</li>
        <li>Cream cheese (for added texture and tangy taste)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream </li>
        <li>Chicken broth (for added flavor)</li>
        <li>Garlic </li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the butter, cream cheese, heavy cream, chicken broth, and garlic to a skillet over medium heat. Cook it for 5 minutes;</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese and let it bubble for about a minute;</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp and cook for 5-6 minutes;</li>
        <li>Season to taste and toss with the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
