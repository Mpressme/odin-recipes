    <h2>This salmon patties recipe is an inexpensive pantry meal that's ready in just 30 minutes!</h2>

    <p>Also known as salmon cakes, these salmon patties are one of my favorite things to make with canned salmon. You can make them with cooked fresh salmon, but the real selling point for me is how fast they are to make with canned salmon on busy weeknights since it's already cooked!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon - canned pink or sockeye is best for flavor and texture</li>
        <li>Egg - a classic binding agent</li>
        <li>Mayo - gives these patties moisture and a touch of creaminess</li>
        <li>Panko breadcrumbs - they're a fine breadcrumb that helps hold the patties together</li>
        <li>Lemon juice - a pop of brightness that really complements salmon</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce - added savory taste</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard - just a touch amps up the flavor even more!</li>
        <li>Parsley and dill - fresh herbs are a wonderful way to pack in even more deliciousness</li>
        <li>Scallions - these mild green onions go great with salmon</li>
        <li>Olive oil - for frying up these patties until crispy and golden brown</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the butter, cream cheese, heavy cream, chicken broth, and garlic to a skillet over medium heat. Cook it for 5 minutes;</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese and let it bubble for about a minute;</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp and cook for 5-6 minutes;</li>
        <li>Season to taste and toss with the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
